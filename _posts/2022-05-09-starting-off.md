First task was to get this blog up and going. I went with:

- google domains for the domain
- github pages / jekyll for the site

Going with github pages forces jekyll on you if you want stuff to "just work". It seems like an ok choice for now and wasn't
too hard to setup. It felt hacky to modify the theme, but it looks like the tradeoff is ease of maintenace for the
theme maintainers.

This post is here to give me an excuse to get the blog up. Normally, I'll be writing
down anything interesting I notice while finishing my side project. If nothing
else, it'll be a good journal.
