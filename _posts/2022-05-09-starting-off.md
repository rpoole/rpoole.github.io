First task was to get this blog up and going. I went with:

- google domains for the domain
- github pages / jekyll for the site

Going with github pages forces jekyll on you if you want stuff to "just work". It seems like an ok choice for now and wasn't
too hard to setup. I'll definitely be revisiting it later.
